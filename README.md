<h2>Plan</h2>
<h4>I created a wireframe using Figma, sticking to a slick, but simple design.</h4>



<H4>After wireframing, I mapped out tasks into a Trello board to organize the project</H4>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<h3>Models & Views</h3>
<p>I began by shaping my backend by defining my models.</p>

<h3>Djoser</h3>
<p>i utlized Djoser for my User auth. I tested these via Postman</p>

<h3>Displaying API</h3>
<p>I worked with MaterialUI to utlize cards and boxes to display my game cards on the discover page.</p>

<h3>Statuses</h3>
<p>I was running out of time on the deadline, so I made the statuses simpler by just having a content option.</p>

<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>I made use of AWS S3 buckets so that the user could upload a profile picture</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>I left out features such as showcasing what game the user is currently playing , and my collection due to time cosntriant</p>

<h2>Successes</h2>
<h3>Happy with the UI</h3>
<h3>Learnt about djoser</h3>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Friend requests, like and comment under statuses</p>
